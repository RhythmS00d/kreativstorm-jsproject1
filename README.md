This week presented us with a new challenge to make a Js script that will beat the evil AI in the game of Rock, Paper and Scissors.

Our team goal is to play 5 rounds with AI and beat it to save the world.

## Implementation

1. Create a function that randomly play as a computer.
2. Create a win logic.
3. Create a function that plays a round taking user input through prompt().
4. Create a function that loops for 5 rounds and plays the game.
5. Add a cool backstory and messages.
